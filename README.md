Overview
This Android application is designed to retrieve user data from a remote server, store it locally, and display it in a RecyclerView. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern and utilizes various Android Jetpack components such as Room, Retrofit, Hilt, and Kotlin Coroutines.
